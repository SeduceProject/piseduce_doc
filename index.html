<h2 class="post-title">The PiSeduce Project</h2>
<p>With the <a href="https://seduce.fr/" target="_blank">Seduce Project</a>, we study both thermal and power management
aspects in datacenters. The energy needed to build a whole datacenter room is huge. It requires many people with
specific competences, persevering and calm leaders and, of course, lot of time and money. So, we want to build a more
flexible infrastructure for our research studies that would be fast to deploy, easy to maintain and cheap enough to
enable other motivated people to replicate it.</p>
<h2 class="post-title">A Raspberry Pi Cluster</h2>
<p> We were looking for small (in size) computing units at lower price which do not require a cooling system and a
specific software stack. So we bought Raspberry Pis to set up our first cluster. Thanks to the popularity of these
computing platforms, a large number of projects already exists, and so, it is easy to find documentation and do not
waste time to build our cluster. With the Raspbian system, we can install and configure usual softwares running on
Debian operating system. Most of all, there are small accessories to increase the capacities of the Raspberry,
especially, the <a href=""https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/poe-hat/>PoE HAT</a>. With this device, Raspberry must be
capable of being powered from PoE (Power over Ethernet) switches. To conclude, Raspberry Pi is the best candidate to
compose our easy-to-use cluster that consists of one PoE switch, Raspberry Pis, PoE&nbsp;HATs, Ethernet cables, SD
cards.  With less than 1000&nbsp;euros, we build and run our cluster.</p>
<h2 class="post-title">PiSeduce Resource Manager</h2>
<p>In order to share our new infrastructure with the team, the next step was to develop a software to configure
Raspberry Pis and provide end-users with ready to use systems. The PiSeduce Resource Manager allows users to reserve
Raspberry Pis for some time, choose the software stack that they want to use and get login information. The software
stack is built in Python and provides a web interface to administrators and users. See nice screenshots in our
<a href="/category/user/index.html">user guide</a>.</p>
