<h2 class="post-title">The PiSeduce Project</h2>
<p>
    With the <a href="https://seduce.fr/" target="_blank">Seduce Project</a>, we study both thermal and power management
    aspects in datacenters. The energy needed to build a whole datacenter room is huge. It requires many people with
    specific competences, persevering and calm leaders and, of course, lot of time and money. So, with the <b>PiSeduce
    Project</b>, we want to build a more flexible infrastructure for our research studies that would be fast to deploy,
    easy to maintain and cheap enough to enable other motivated people to replicate it.

<h2 class="post-title">A Raspberry Pi Cluster</h2>
<p>
    We were looking for small (in size) computing units at lower price which do not require a cooling system and a
    specific software stack. So we bought Raspberry Pis to set up our first cluster. Thanks to the popularity of these
    computing platforms, a large number of projects already exists, and so, it is easy to find documentation and do not
    waste time to build our cluster. With the Raspbian system, we can install and configure usual softwares running on
    Debian operating system. Most of all, there are small accessories to increase the capacities of the Raspberry,
    especially, the <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/poe-hat/" target="_blank">PoE HAT</a>. With this
    device, Raspberry must be capable of being powered from PoE (Power over Ethernet) switches. To conclude, Raspberry
    Pi is the best candidate to compose our easy-to-use cluster that consists of one PoE switch, Raspberry Pis,
    PoE&nbsp;HATs, Ethernet cables, SD cards. With less than 1000&nbsp;euros, we build and run our cluster.

<h2 class="post-title">PiSeduce Resource Manager</h2>
<p>
    In order to share our new infrastructure with the team, the next step was to develop a software to configure
    Raspberry Pis and provide end-users with ready to use systems. The PiSeduce Resource Manager allows users to reserve
    Raspberry Pis for some time, choose the software stack that they want to use and get login information. The software
    stack is built in Python and provides a web interface to administrators and users. The resource manager is
    divided into two open source projects hosted on GitHub:
    <a href="http://github.com/remyimt/piseduce_webui" target="_blank">piseduce_webui</a> and
    <a href="http://github.com/remyimt/piseduce_agent" target="_blank">piseduce_agent</a>. Learn more about the resource
    manager on our <a href="/category/user-guide/index.html">user guide</a>.
