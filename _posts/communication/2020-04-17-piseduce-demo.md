subtitle: Using Raspberry Pi without Knowledge

The PiSeduce project aims at simplifying the deployment of computer resource platforms. This documentation shows the
information to make a cluster from scratch and install the PiSeduce software stack. Then, users can connect to the
resource manager web interface in order to easily use Raspberry Pis, as computer resources, without knowing how to
install the operating system. The Raspbian operating system deployed on the Raspberry Pi includes common debian
packages, and so, the Raspberrys are user-friendly for Linux users. In this video, we show the reservation of three
Raspberry Pis from the resource manager.
